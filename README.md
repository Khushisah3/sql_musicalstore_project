Schema- Music Store Database

The Music Store Analysis project involves querying a database containing tables related to employees, customers, invoices, tracks, artists, and genres. The questions range from basic aggregations (finding top invoices, best customers, and senior employees) to moderate-level joins (identifying Rock music listeners, top artists, and longest tracks) and advanced analysis (determining customer spending on artists, most popular genres per country, and top spenders). To solve these, SQL techniques such as aggregations (SUM(), COUNT()), filtering (WHERE, HAVING), joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN), and ranking (RANK(), DENSE_RANK()) are essential. Queries will often require linking multiple tables, using subqueries, and applying window functions for ranking and comparisons. Understanding table relationships is crucial to efficiently extract insights from the database.
